### How
1. Place the photoresistors in front of the screen, aligned with the future path of the dino
2. Place the microphone close to a source of music
3. Play some good beating music
4. Start the game by pressing space bar or arrow key up


with photoresistors ,
            a microphone hearing music,
An esp32 receives signals from photoresistors to make the dino jump over cacti 
                                            & microphone to make the dino duck at the beat of music.

## Electronics
- esp32
- 3 photoresistors
- 3 capacitors of 100Âµf
- microphone vma309
- oled monitor ssd1306

The esp32 
  - receives the signal from
    - the 3 photoresistors:
      - the first detects the first passage of the cacti
      - the second detects the second passage of the cacti
      - the third detects the state of the background (day/night)
  - calculates the interval between the 2 passages to get the speed
  - sends the keyboard command arrow up to make the dino jump
    - a microphone vma309 
  - sends the keyboard command arrow down to make the dino duck

### esp32
Please follow the instructions here to use correctly the ESP32 socket:

When running on arduino, go to "Tools/serial plotter" to watch the signal coming from the photo-resistors
